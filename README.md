I created a simple work day planner. Built with jQuery and Day.js, it's a straightforward calendar app designed to simplify your daily routine. Opening it feels as intuitive as checking the date on your phone. Scroll down, and you'll find neatly organized timeblocks for your standard work hours, making planning a breeze. The color-coded system adds a touch of clarity â€“ past, present, and future events are easily distinguishable. it's a digital sidekick, keeping you on top of your game in the midst of your day-to-day hustle.
